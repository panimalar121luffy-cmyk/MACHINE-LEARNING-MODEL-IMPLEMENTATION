*DESCRIPTION*:
During my internship, I worked on a Spam Email Classification project using Python and machine learning. I started by loading and exploring a dataset of SMS messages, which contained both spam and ham (non-spam) texts. I performed data preprocessing by cleaning the text (lowercasing, removing punctuation, and extra spaces) and converting labels into binary values. To transform the text into numerical features, I applied TF-IDF vectorization with unigrams and bigrams, which helped capture important word patterns.I then trained and evaluated three different machine learning models: Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Each model was tested on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with SVM achieving the highest performance (accuracy ~98%). I also generated a confusion matrix and classification report to visualize model performance. Additionally, I analyzed the most important words that indicate spam versus ham messages using model coefficients.To make the project practical, I implemented a prediction function that classifies new messages as spam or ham, along with their probability scores. I tested this with sample messages like promotional offers and casual conversations. Finally, I saved the trained model and vectorizer using joblib, and created a simple deployment function that can classify real email text inputs.This project gave me hands-on experience in text preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment. It helped me understand how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems like spam detection, and strengthened my skills in Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.
